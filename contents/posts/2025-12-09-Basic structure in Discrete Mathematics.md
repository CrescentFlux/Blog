## Set
- **Concept**
  - A set is an unordered collection of objects.The objects are also called the elements of the set. The expression a∈A indicates that the set A contains the element a .
  - Empty set: it is a special set  with no elements.
  - Singleton set: it's a set that contains exactly one element.
  - Subset: A set A is the subset of set B if and only if every elements of A is also an element of B.A⊆B means that the all elements are in B.Conversely,A∉B .
  - Power set :if the power set of a set S is a set of all subset of S. The expression is 𝒫(S).
  - Cartesian product:The Caretsian product of two set A and B denoted by A×B.mathematical expression :A×B ={a,b |a∈A ∧ b∈B}
  - Note:A₁× A₂× A₃,⋯,× Aₙ ={(a₁, a₂, a₃, ⋯, aₙ) | aᵢ∈ Aᵢ,i=1,2,3,...,n} 
  - set-builder notation with quantifiers: 
     - The Universal quantification of P(x) is taken over all elements of the set S . ∀x∈S(P(x)) means that ∀x(x∈S → P(x)) 
     - Conversely,Existential quantification : ∃x∈S(P(x)) / ∃x(x∈S → P(x)) 
  - Truth set:The truth set of predicate P(x) over a domain D is the set of all elements in D for which P(x) is true.Mathematical Notation:{x∈D|P(x)}
- **Operation**
  - Union: The union is a set that contains all elements which are in A or B(or both).Mathematical notation: A∪B ={x∈A ∨ x∈B}
  - Intersetion: The intersetion of two set A and B is the set containing all elements that are common to both A and B.Notation:A∩B = {x∈A ∧ x∈B}
  - Principle of inclusion-exclusion:|A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B|
  - Set difference: the set diffrence of  A and B,donated by  A \ B or A − B, is the set of all elements that are in A but not in B. Formally: A \ B = { x | x ∈ A and x ∉ B }.
  - Complement: Given universal set 𝕌,the complement of a set A means is the set of all elements in 𝕌 but not in A.notation:
  Ā = { x∈𝕌 | x∉A }
