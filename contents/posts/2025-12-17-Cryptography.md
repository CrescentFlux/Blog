### Cryptography
- Classical cryptography:formally,f(p)=p+3mod 26,p is the postive integer.f⁻¹(p)=p-3mod 26;⇒f(p)=(p+k)mod 26,f⁻¹(p)=(p-k)mod 26.k is key.
   - encryptaion:The process of securing information.
   - cryptanalysis:Attempting to break cryptographic systems without authorized access.
- Block cipher:The method of substituting one set of letters for anothor.
- Cryptosystem:A cryptosystem  is defined by five components .formally,𝒫 = (P, C, K, E, D),P is the set of plaintexts,C is the set of ciphertexts, K is the set of keys,E is the set of entryption functions,D is the set of detryption functions.
- Public key cryptography:In classical cryptography ,the same key is used for entryption  and decryption .Requiring  secure key distribution - a major weakness.Public key cryptography slove this problem by using a key pair :it works like a locked mailbox.
- RSA:encryption:c = mᵉ (mod n);  decryption:m ≡ cᵈ mod (n)
- Cryptographic protocal:A defined sequence of steps involving two or more paties,designed to achieve a specific security goal using cryptographic primitives.
